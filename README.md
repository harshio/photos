The final project is in the main branch; Chloe's initial commit is in the second branch. Also note that, on MacOS, after closing the AlertDialog window (which usually only shows up due to corruption in our application, which itself should be rare to impossible), the main window of the application is not automatically refocused on. You'll probably notice that the code's still running; The application's probably hidden, still running, in some java folder. I don't know if this disclaimer is necessary, but I wanted to be cautious.
